# Mod Version: 1.0.0

Adds 1x1 versions of a few workbenchs. They have a workspeed penalty (70% base speed), take longer to build, and are more fragile. But they use less space.

Load this near the bottom of your modlist! This will reduce compatibility issues and allow Tiny Workbenchs to include recipes added to the vanilla workbenchs by other mods (in theory).

Inspired by (and ripping off) [Voyager's "Small Workbenches](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1331181010andsearchtext=Small+Workbenches); which was under an MIT license.

These textures aren't up to 1.0 quality, and I'm a lazy person who made them all single rotated textures instead of proper multi-graphics. If anyone would like to contribute their fancy art skills to this mod, I'll credit them accordingly.
